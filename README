bmp2xpm is an embarrassingly simple image processing program which
converts BMP (v3) files to XPM (v3) files.  I'm writing this to get a
better idea of parallel programming in Haskell.

To build and run this program, do this:

    cabal configure
    cabal build
    ./dist/build/bmp2xpm/bmp2xpm input.bmp output.xpm

Use a sandbox if you need to.

For a profiling build, do this:

    ghc -O2 -rtsopts -threaded -prof Main.hs -o Main.exe

We'll need profiling libraries.  Install ghc-prof!
